Variables, A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.

in variables use A -Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscores. Python is case sensitive, so variable and     Variable are different variables.
 
 
 Rules for identifiers:

 1. identifiers can be combination of upper and lower case letters, digits, and underscores(_)
    so myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.

 2. An identifier cannot start with a digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not.

 3. we cannot use any special characters like @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, +, [, ], =,
    {, }, |, \, :, ;, <,>,., /,?, `, ~,

    etc. but they should not be used for built-in functions or keywords. For example, print, 
    while, if, else, etc. are not valid identifiers.

 4. identifier can be of any length.

 5. variables name can be simple, short, and meaningfull

 6. Case Sensitivity, Python is case sensitive, so "Name" and "name" are different identifiers.
